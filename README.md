# zsh-proton-helper
this is a plugin for zsh shell to make it easyer to use the valve proton package.
the aim for this package is to make it possible to run a windows/wine software. 
that is ment for the game in question most like a mod manager, or other application
that belongs to the software.

only problem is how steam games are doing things like for the software to be able to work,
the application id or "appid" f.eks TES Oblivion is 22330... 
proton uses the appid to make the Prefix ID folder or wine prefix.
